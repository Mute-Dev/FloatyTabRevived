Inspired by the original Floaty Tab thank you Dylan West

IMPORT NOTE: IF YOU HAVE SYSTEM INFO CUSTOM SCREEN RESOLUTION AND YOU WILL NEED TO DISABLE THAT OTHERWISE YOU WILL EXPERIENCE SLIGHTLY OFF CENTERED WITH FLOATYTAB. IF YOU USE IOS ZOOM MODE VIEW AND SWITCH TO STANDARD MODE VIEW WILL CENTERED FLOATYTAB CORRECTLY.

    I have added App List so you can enable 3rd party application too (PLEASE NOTE: If the app you enabled keep crashing or experience any issue then that mean FloatyTab isn't compatiable with that app then you will need to disable it from app list)
